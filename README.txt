INSTINCT is an open source project developed by the UW and AFSC, and with funding by NOAA HPC. INSTINCT is an autodetection system implemented in the Luigi framework. 

This project is the open alpha version of INSTINCT. A more comprehensive README, list of features, and operating instructions will be provided in the beta stage of the project. 
For now, feel free to peek at functionality currently being worked on. If you are very eager to use this system while
it is still in alpha, please reach out to me (daniel.woodrich@noaa.gov) to see if earlier collaboration makes sense. 

Beta testing and collaboration will be desired once the system reaches beta stage. 

For more information about the INSTINCT det/class algorithm, see https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/27222 . 
Note that this refers to a previous build of the algorithm, not available here. Source code available upon request. 
The original det/class algorithm is an extension of the presented method in Ross & Allen 2014
