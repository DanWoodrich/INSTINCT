1. Make sure Python (>3.0.0) is installed 
2. Add python and INSTINCT binaries to your user or system PATH
	a. Search for environmental variable in Windows search- select option that allows for changing variables in user account
	b. Add the python ~/Scripts folder as a new PATH 
	b. Add the INSTINCT ~/bin folder as a new PATH 
3. Make sure Git Bash is installed.  
4. Identify and/or create directory for app location. I use 'C:/Apps'
5. ‘Clone’ the repository from https://github.com/DanWoodrich/INSTINCT into target directory 
	a. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
	b. Additional config will be needed as a Git user if planning on contributing to the project. Find guides online to authorize yourself as a git user in these cases. 

6. In the CMD terminal, navigate to ~/INSTINCT/etc
	a. Use command ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’

7. Copy the file ~/INSTINCT/etc/INSTINCT_ex.cfg and rename it ~/INSTINCT/etc/INSTINCT.cfg. This is a personal config file which will be ignored by git. 

Optional: 
To load in all submodules:
1. navigate in git bash shell to ~/INSTINCT . type: 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
2. To further update changes in submodules, navigate to ~/INSTINCT in git bash shell and type: 'git submodule update --remote --merge'

The following will require admin privileges
3. Install 7zip (recommended, helps to troubleshoot intermediates in cache)
